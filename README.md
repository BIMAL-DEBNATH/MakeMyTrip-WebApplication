# MakeMyTrip-WebApplication

This project is a backend service for a travel booking application called Make-My-Trip. It uses Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL database to provide RESTful APIs for various features such as searching, booking, cancelling, and reviewing flights, hotels, and packages.

## Features

- **Flight Search:** Users can search for available flights based on their origin, destination, date, and number of passengers. The service returns a list of flights with details such as airline, flight number, departure and arrival time, duration, price, and availability.
- **Flight Booking:** Users can book a flight by providing their personal and payment information. The service validates the input and confirms the booking by generating a booking ID and sending an email confirmation to the user.
- **Flight Cancellation:** Users can cancel a flight booking by providing their booking ID. The service verifies the booking and processes the cancellation by refunding the payment and sending an email confirmation to the user.

## Technologies

- **Java:** The programming language used to develop the backend service.
- **Spring Boot:** The framework used to create standalone, production-grade Spring based applications that run on embedded servers such as Tomcat or Jetty.
- **MySQL:** The relational database management system used to store and manage data for the backend service.
- **Maven:** The tool used to manage dependencies and build automation for the backend service.
- **Postman:** The tool used to test and document the RESTful APIs for the backend service.
